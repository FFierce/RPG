A little documentation on this.

This is just a simple password generator I made in my spare time, consisting of a dark theme and some cool little features.

You can customize the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and manifest; the icons are customizable too.
`manifest.json`
`popup.html`
`styles.css`
`popup.js`
`icons/image`
To cuztomize the image, simply change the ` "icons": {
      "16": "icons/RPG.png",
      "32": "icons/RPG.png",
      "48": "icons/RPG.png",
      "128": "icons/RPG.png"
    },` section.
